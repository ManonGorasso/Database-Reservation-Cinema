DATABASE RESERVATION CINEMA

Hello,
This is a Database project made on MySQL 8.0, for a cinema ticket booking system.


The different files needs to be read and added to the database in this order : 

bdd-cinema-create.sql
bdd-cinema-insert.sql
bdd-insert-screening.sql
bdd-insert-ticket.sql

You can then use the following files and their queries as you wish to test the database :

bdd-read.sql
bdd-update-ticket.sql


Thanks for reading, have a nice day !
